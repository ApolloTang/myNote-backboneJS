:: Client id (cid)

    cid is a uniquly assigned identifier for each instance of model:

:: Manually attach an id to instant of model:

    var M = Backbone.Model.extend();
    var m1 = new M;
    m1.id = Math.random().toString(36).substr(2)   // set custom id
    console.log(m1.id);                            // get custom id

:: Manually attached an id to Constructor

       var Meal = Backbone.Model.extend({ idAttribute: "_id" });



Backbone.js - id vs idAttribute vs cid
=======================================

what is the connection between ID, CID and idAttribute ? how
do they affect each other?

    Both the cid and id should be unique id's for the model, and
    can be used to retrieve a model from a collection.

    *cid* is assigned by backbone.js client side and is useful if you
    don't have an actual id, either because the model hasn't been
    saved yet to the server or perhaps you aren't even saving it
    to a db (maybe your using localStorage).


    The *id* attribute should be the id of the model that comes from
    your server (that is what the id is in your db .

    *idAttribute* tells backbone which "field" (in the model attribute
    coming from your server it should use to update the id attribute.
    By default this is set to "id", but as it says in the documentation
    if your server uses something else you can set it to that (the
    example given is setting it to "_id".

when exactly do a new model gets its ID ?
is that the server assigning it?
do I need to write it down in the "defaults" of the Model (maybe
as a function?) ?
maybe the "addNewModel" function should do that?

    They should get the new id's when saved to the server and you
    shouldn't need to set it manually (based on the idattribute) unless
    you need more control over the process.
