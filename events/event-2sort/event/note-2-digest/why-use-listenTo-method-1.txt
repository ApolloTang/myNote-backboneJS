listenTo/stopListening methods introduced in Backbone 0.9.9 use on/off methods with some useful addition - they store current event listeners in internal object called _listeners.

The benefit of using this object is that you always know full list of all your listeners - you can iterate over it and remove specific elements from it (remember that listener is just a function and a function is just an object).

So, you can call it this way:

    this.stopListening(emmiting_object, ["reset", "add"]) 

Above will remove "reset" and "remove" listeners from emmiting_object

    this.stopListening(emmiting_object) 

Above will remove all listeners from emmiting_object

    this.stopListening() 
    
Above iterate over _listenets object and remove all listeners (this is probably the most usable case).
    
So, using this methods you can convert your teardown method to something like this:

    this.teardown = function(){
      this.stopListening();
      ...
    }
